# Discord-Hyperplanning-Schedule

Somewhat old project that was used to fetch schedules on Hyperplanning and post them in the respective discord channels of the students
Made to learn about:
- Task scheduling (automated this process using Windows Task Scheduler)
- Selenium automation
- Image manipulation (in memory)
- Web scraping
- Using configuration files
